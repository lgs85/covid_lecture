## Talk outline

- What is COVID-19?
- Why is it spreading so fast?
- How do we predict the consequences of the disease? 
- How do we tell if our predictions are likely to be accurate?
- How can we slow and stop the spread of the COVID-19?





# What is COVID-19? 





## What is COVID-19? | Defining some terms

- **COVID-19** is a disease (short for coronavirus disease 2019)
- **SARS-CoV-2** is the virus that causes COVID-19 (short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)
- **Coronavirus** is a general name for the group of viruses that include SARS-CoV-2.

## SARS-CoV-2 is a virus
- A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus
- Closest relative is a virus found in bats
- May have passed through an intermediate host (e.g. pangolins) before being transmitted to humans, but not yet clear

</font>


<div class="notes">
- Positive sense viruses can directly translate viral RNA sequence into viral proteins, so no RNA polymerase needed

</div>









## COVID-19 is a disease

- Incubation period typically 5-6 days, but may be shorter or longer
- Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulties with breathing
- In many cases symptoms are mild or absent
- But in others can lead to pneumonia, organ failure and death






## Testing for COVID-19

Two main approaches:

- Look for the virus (RT-PCR)
- Look for an immune response to the virus (serological testing)
- RT-PCR approach is well established, whereas serological testing still in development

## Why is COVID-19 spreading so fast? | Exponential growth

```{r,fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, fig.align = "center"}
t <- 40
r <- 0.3
x0 <- 10

output <- x0 * (1+r)^c(1:t)

plot(output,type = "l",
     xlab = "Time (days)",
     ylab = "Number of cases")
```






## Why is COVID-19 spreading so fast? | Exponential growth

- Growth where the amount being added is proportional to the amount already present (e.g. Doubling over time)
- $x_t = x_0(1+r)^t$
- Where *r* is the growth rate and *t* is time

# How do we predict the consequences of the disease? 







## How do we predict the consequences of the disease? | What do we want to predict?

- The number of people infected
- The number of people with symptoms
- The number of deaths
- The ability of healthcare systems to cope





## How do we predict the consequences of the disease? | Building a model

- What is the transmission potential of the disease? 
- What proportion of infected people show mild/severe symptoms?
- What is the fatality rate?
- What is the capacity of a given healthcare system?









## How do we predict the consequences of the disease? | Building a model

What is the transmission potential of the disease? 

- How easily the virus is transmitted
- Rate of contact in a population
- Duration of infection
- The proprtion of susceptible individuals in a population






## How do we predict the consequences of the disease? | What is the transmission potential of the disease? 


- $R_0$ is the *Basic reproduction number*
- The average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person, in a population where everyone is susceptible
- Encapsulates mode of transmission, contact rates, duration of infection.





## How do we predict the consequences of the disease? | What is the transmission potential of the disease? 

- $R_0$ is an average, so summarises a distribution. This distribution is important.
- $R_0$ can change depending on context (e.g. behaviour). This is very important.
- $R_0$ is difficult to estimate, so different researchers can come up with different estimates. This is very very important.
