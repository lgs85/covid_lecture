# The models underlying COVID19 policy

This repository includes slides and code for the YouTube lecture I made on the maths and statistics behind COVID19 policy, aimed at my first year undergraduate students. You can watch the YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLvz0MzHuPY&feature=youtu.be)

Some caveats. I am not a virologist or an epidemioloist, but a biologist with some expertise in modelling and data science. My aim here is to provide an overview for an undergraduate audience, but please let me know if you have any feedback or concerns. It's also the case that things are changing rapidly, so this lecture may become out of date quite soon.

The powerpoint file of the slides is called `covid_lecture.pptx`. The Rmarkdown file, ending in `.Rmd`, contains the code used to make the slides. You will need all the images, and recent versions of R and Rstudio, in order to make to make powerpoint files with Rmarkdown.
