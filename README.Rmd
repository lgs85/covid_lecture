This repository includes slides and code for the YouTube lecture I made on the maths and statistics behind COVID19 policy, aimed at my first year undergraduate students. You can watch the YouTube video <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLvz0MzHuPY&feature=youtu.be"> here </a>

The powerpoint file of the slides is called `covid_lecture.pptx`. The Rmarkdown file, ending in `.Rmd`, contains the code used to make the slides. You will need all the images, and recent versions of R and Rstudio, in order to make to make powerpoint files with Rmarkdown.
